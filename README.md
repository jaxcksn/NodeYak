# NodeYak - A NodeJS YikYak API Wrapper

A javascript library for posting and interacting with the YikYak API.

## Important Note:

This library is for education purposes only. Using the API directly for any reason is against YikYak community guidelines, and will/can result in being banned from the platform.

Additionally, I will not be documenting nor providing a method anywhere in the project on getting authorization/refresh tokens for the API.
